If you are a developer:

You can edit this application as you normally would with any GitHub project. Once you make a few pull 
requests, you can request to become a Collaborator if you plan on makeing more commitments.


You can help by writing better instructions for the user, e.g.: steps of the application clearer. Because 
you are not a developer, you probably do not have Visual Studio or another IDE, so just make your edits 
in Google docs. (Make a copy of 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b3fFbn1vUcqQQwB1BOBISWw4w1RQYtvlMi692S6M3So/edit?u
sp=sharing [copy and paste that link]) Send your document to "chompy33" (PJBeans) on XDA through a 
private message (just copy and paste)

You can also create images you feel should be in this application, or modify images. The design for the 
floating buttons (Next, About) are in the Git Repository at `\LineageOS Installer\images\`. For some 
reason, they are currently also in the root directory; do NOT modify them! Please modify theme in the 
directory specified  above, so I can easily merge your pull request. (See below if you do not have GitHub 
or Git on your PC)

NOTE: Please download GitHub onto your PC and clone this program's source onto your desktop. Follow
this guide: https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/ (copy and paste

other guides, or do a Google Search.
