# Lineage-OS-Installer
A (currently) unofficial installer for LineageOS.

This is the source for the UNOFFICIAL Lineage OS Installer for Windows. At the time of creating this program, Lineage OS is not prebuilt and ready for download, so when I tested it, I simply subsituted Lineage OS for CyanogenMod. It was tested on my Nexus 7 2013 WiFi (flo), and worked just fine. I do not know if it will work for non-nexus devices, but I am certain it will not work with Samsung devices, as the installation script does not utilize Download Mode. If enough people like the idea of this installer, I (or perhaps someone in the community) will give support to Samsung devices. If people begin to contribute, we can change the author name in the script and graphical program (this) from "PJBeans" to "LineageOS Community"

# What is here:

- Embedded web browsers for downloading TWRP and LineageOS* [See "What is not here"]*
- Images to illustrate where to find Developer Options, USB Debugging, and OEM Unlocking
- The prebuilt program includes a setup script that copies all needed files.

# What is not here:
- Lineage OS Download page in embedded browser (for it is not live)
- Support for Samsung Devices
- Possibly support for other devices (If Fastboot mode acts differently for some reason on other devices; I am not sure)

# FAQ:

This program is an unofficial almost-automatic install for Lineage OS, designed for beginers or users who just would like to install Lineage OS and be done; for users who don't care how to install a ROM, who just want it on their phone.

[-] What does this program do?

This program on its own does not do much; in fact, all it does it give 2 embedded web browsers to download Lineage OS and TWRP. However, it gives a step-by-step explanition on what do, where to save the files, and what to name them. Lineage OS is acually installed through a script included at [insert link here]

[-] Why would I want to use this?

Well, you probably don't. This installer was made for folks who would like to install Lineage OS on there phone or tablet, but are to scared to, and just would like to have it on their phone or tablet, and be done. *If you want to learn how to install ROMS, already know how to install ROMS, or are a developer, this program is not for you.
